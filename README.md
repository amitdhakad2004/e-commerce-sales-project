# e-commerce-sales-project
Objective of the Project
The objective of this project is to deliver a 360-degree analysis of e-commerce sales data using a combination of SQL, Pandas, and Power BI, aimed at driving strategic business decisions. The project focuses on converting raw transactional data into actionable insights for stakeholders across marketing, operations, finance, and customer service.

Key purposes of the project include:

Understanding Sales & Revenue Trends: Analyzing daily, monthly, and yearly sales patterns to track revenue growth and seasonality, helping to forecast future sales.

Customer Behavior Analysis: Identifying loyal customers, detecting churn, segmenting customers by spending patterns (Gold, Silver, Bronze), and recognizing customer preferences by region.

Product Performance Assessment: Pinpointing top-selling products, underperforming items, unsold inventory, and products with consistent monthly sales to inform inventory and marketing strategies.

Payment & Transaction Insights: Examining preferred payment methods, payment success/failure rates, and detecting potential payment anomalies to enhance the checkout process and reduce revenue leakage.

Regional Sales Insights: Mapping sales by geographic locations to discover regional strengths and opportunities for targeted marketing efforts.

Visualization & Reporting: Building interactive dashboards in Power BI with KPIs, trend analysis, geo-analysis, and customer insights for real-time monitoring and executive reporting.

Business Impact: Providing data-backed recommendations to optimize marketing campaigns, improve customer retention, streamline payment processes, and support operational efficiency.

Overall, the project bridges the gap between raw data and strategic action, enabling businesses to improve profitability, enhance customer satisfaction, and make evidence-based decisions confidently.
